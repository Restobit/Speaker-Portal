# Speaker-Portal

This project was created by Restobit.

##Install

Run your favourite Web server and create a direcetory in your web folder which name must be need `speakerportal` because i'm hard coded the project url. (I will fix is soon)

##Database

In this project you can find the `speakerportal.sql` in `database_file` folder. You need to create a database with this file. Go to `localhost/phpmyadmin` url in your favourite browser and select the `Import` menu.
Click on the "Choose file" and search the `speakerportal.sql` location and select this file and press the `Go` button on the page right-bottom side.
Thats all. Now, you created a dabase.
